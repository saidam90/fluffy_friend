<h3>About the Project</h3>

Our team of 4 people built "Fluffy Friend" in just 1 week. Initially, we planned to create a project similar to Airbnb, but decided against simply cloning the concept. Instead, we developed the idea of a pet rental platform. This platform allows you to borrow a pet from someone if you're unable to commit to full-time pet ownershipüê±üê∂

*How it works:*

- Register an account
- Search for pets
- Book the pet you like or 
- Upload a pet you'd like to lend
- Leave a review after your experience

**Features**


<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

Fluffy Friend is optimised for use on all devices.

Frameworks & libraries used:

- Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript
- Stimulus
- CSS & SASS
- Bootstrap

Version control & deployment

<h3>Installation</h3>

To run our app locally, you will need to have already installed Yarn and Rails. Check them with:
```
$ yarn -v 
$ rails --version
```

If no version number is returned, please install Yarn and/or Rails before continuing.

**Dependencies**

You'll also need to install all dependencies of the project with:
```

```

The `bundle` command installs all Ruby Gems specified in our Gemfile. The ```yarn install``` command retrieves all dependencies from the project‚Äôs package.json file.

Run the following command to create a database, load the schema, and initialize it with our seed data. 

```
$ rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

Launch the app by running:
```
$ rails s
```
```
$ yarn build --watch
