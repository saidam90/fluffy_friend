<h3>about-the-project</h3>

Our team of 4 people built "Fluffy Friend" in just 1 week. Initially, we planned to create a project similar to Airbnb, but decided against simply cloning the concept. Instead, we developed the idea of a pet rental platform. This platform allows you to borrow a pet from someone if you're unable to commit to full-time pet ownershipüê±üê∂

*How it works:*

- Register an account
- Search for pets
- Book the pet you like or 
- Upload a pet you'd like to lend
- Leave a review after your experience

**Features**
